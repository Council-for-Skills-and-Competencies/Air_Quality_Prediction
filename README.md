# Machine Learning-Based Forecasting of Air Pollution Levels

## Introduction
Air pollution is a growing environmental and public health challenge worldwide. Rising levels of pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, CO, and O₃ cause respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and millions of premature deaths annually. Predicting air quality accurately can help policymakers and communities take timely preventive measures.

## Objective
The project focuses on:
- Forecasting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning models,  
- Identifying correlations between pollutants and environmental conditions,  
- Providing actionable insights for health and environmental management.  

## Dataset
- **Source**: Air_Quality.csv (monitoring station data)  
- **Features**: Pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, CO, O₃), meteorological variables (temperature, humidity, wind speed), and timestamp  
- **Target Variable**: AQI (Air Quality Index)  

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing,  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),  
3. Feature selection and transformation,  
4. Model training using regression algorithms,  
5. Evaluation with metrics such as R², MAE, and RMSE.  

## Tools and Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## Results
The developed models can accurately forecast AQI, assisting in early warnings and policy interventions.
